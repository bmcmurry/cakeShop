This app is my first attempt at making a website that is designed to take orders from a customer.
The website is a fictitious bakery that has two uses.

1. the customer can view the menu and place orders for themselves.
2. the store manager can manage all of the orders and edit the menu.
   both users will have to login to use this website and the manager if they do not already have an account will have to create a superuser and assign themselves to the admin group on the admin page.
   both users can upload photos. the customer can edit their profile details while the manager can add pictures to the menu items when editing the menu.
   there are decorators on several views controlling what pages the customers and admin have access to.
   this makes it to where the customer can not add menu items or delete other customers orders while the manager can. This also means the manager can not edit the customers profile details.
   The manager can however create new customers if for instance someone placed an order in person and the manager wanted to track it on the website for them.
